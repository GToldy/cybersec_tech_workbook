## Data structures

### What is the purpose of a list (array in some programming languages) data structure? Name some methods of it!
### What is the difference between a list/array and a set?
### What is the purpose and methods of a dictionary/map data structure?

## Algorithms

### Fibonacci sequences. Write a method (or pseudo code), that generates the Fibonacci sequences.
### How do you find a max value in a list/array if you can’t use any built-in functions?
### How do you find the average of values in a list/array if you can’t use any built-in functions?
### Explain an algorithm which sorts a list!

## Programming paradigms - procedural
